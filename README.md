# AndroidSimonGame
My school's final

I had some trouble adding this project to GitHub.

This project is written in C# Xamarin and can run only on Android phones.

I created the Simon game as my finals project because this game is about speed and memory. 
I worked a lot on the algorithm behind the game and about the timing.

Most of my job on the project was about the Crazy-Level.
- Level Number One is the normal Simon game. Every successful turn adds another color to the colors chain.
- Crazy Level is similar to the regular Simon, but it has a twist. After every successful turn, the colors change their positions. The player has to remember the colors and not the positions in order to succeed. Every currect turn adds a color.

The app has an option to save the best 3 players - the ones with the highest scores.
